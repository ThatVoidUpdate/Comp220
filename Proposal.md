## An area for improvement
Too many games these days are focused around the boring 3d Euclidean space, simply because it's the one we happen to live in. What I propose is a game that throws that out the window, and takes place in a 4 dimensional space, containing one extra spatial dimension that our own. Doing so will allow the stacking of theoretically infinite 3d spaces next to each other, making it orders of magnitude more content than a normal boring 3d game.

## One or more approaches to addressing the problem
There are two main schools of thought for showing 4d hypershapes in 3d space: Projection and Slicing. In the projection method, the entire shape is crushed down into 3d space, allowing all parts of it to be seen at once. This gives rise to the classic Tesseract shape of a hypercube, which apears to be a small cube inside a larger cube. The smaller cube only appears smaller because of perspective, and is the same size as the other cube, however it is distorted by perspective. The other method is simply taking a 3d cross-section of the hypershape. This would show a hypercube just as a normal cube, and would not allow the viewing of all parts of the hypershape at the same time.

The two main approaches for this problem is to either use a projection of 4D onto 3D space (the method that gives rise to the classic tesseract image), or to take 3D slices through the 4D world, which would be easier for a 3d person to intuitively understand

## The benefits of your suggested approach(es)
When I do this, I would prefer the slicing method over projection. This view is more intuitive from a 3d perspective, as looking at it would be akin to looking at a 3d scene. However, moving along the 4th dimension would make the shapes appear to morph and shift, when in reality they are simply being moved.

I would prefer to use slicing over projection, sicne it is easier for a 3d player to understand, and probably easier to program

## Any challenges you can foresee with implementing your approach(es)
4d maths is very hard, and I have been working on and off on it for over a year now, without significant headway being made. However, since this is actually being done for the uni now, I should be able to get more support from uni staff with this matter, which shopuld help me along massively.

4d maths is a pain, and I can forsee many problems trying to get it working correctly, but now that this is a university project, I should be able to get help more easily, if needed
